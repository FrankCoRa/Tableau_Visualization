This project analyzes incident frequency across NYC boroughs and neighborhoods, uncovering recurring patterns and assessing the correlation between household income and complaint frequency. The visualization offers actionable insights into the socio-economic factors influencing incident trends, helping to inform data-driven decision
## Data Used For This Project
311 Service Requests from 2022-2023 (3,175,485 rows, filetype: .csv, Location: New York City)

## Key Analytical Questions Addressed in this Data Visualization Project
In this project, we will uncover key insights by addressing the following questions:
- Which boroughs experience the highest number of incidents?
- What are the three neighborhoods with the most and least incidents in each borough?
- What type of incident occurs most frequently, expressed as a percentage?
- Which neighborhood boasts the highest household income within each borough?
- Is there a correlation between the frequency of calls/complaints and household income across different locations (top 20 percentiles)?
## Project Visualization Overview
This project requires either Tableau Desktop or Tableau Cloud for optimal visualization, as Tableau Public lacks the necessary memory capacity to handle our data. Utilizing these platforms ensures seamless interaction with complex datasets and enhances data storytelling through dynamic visualizations.
